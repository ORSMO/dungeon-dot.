# Dungeon Dot

Landscape-first physics dungeon crawler. The game runs from `index.html`.

## V7.8 room encounters

- **Enemy nests:** Occasional destructible nest objectives in combat rooms. Nests spawn basic enemies until destroyed; reflected bullets, bat swings, and nearby barrel explosions can damage them. Clearing a room requires destroying any surviving nests.
- **Interactive traps:** Pressure plates trigger one spike lane when stepped on by a player or enemy, and levers trigger another when struck by the bat. Spike crushers damage enemies and the player. Cracked walls can be shattered with the bat, reflected bullets, or nearby explosive barrels. Controls re-arm after a cooldown.
- **Teamwork AI:** Plain melee enemies take flanking paths, some guard nearby ranged allies, ranged enemies seek cover behind plain bodies, and nearby basic enemies briefly retreat when an armored or elite ally falls. Existing obstacle avoidance remains active.
- **Dungeon events:** Random combat rooms can trigger an ambush, temporary earthquake gaps, a fleeing treasure dot, or an elite invasion. Events occur at most once per room and must resolve before the exit unlocks.

The update leaves the existing save version and cleared-room checkpoints compatible. No new graphics or external dependencies are required.
